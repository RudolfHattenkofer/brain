Concepts that are large are compressed so they fit into ones mind with all other relevant parts -> Abstraction

Compress existing so you never need to worry about it anymore, or only worry in very special and rare circumstances

JIT learning -> Leaky abstraction means you can get a lot done without worrying about the details for a while.

Rough outline of things in existence is sufficient as long as you know where to look it up in case there is a reason to.
