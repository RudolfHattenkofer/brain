There’s two modes of thinking: Creative/innovative thinking that opens possibilities, and rational/efficient thinking that chooses a path. Both are necessary for success!

These are typically combined by generating a whole bunch of designs/possible solutions, and then narrowing them down by applying the constraints for a real world solution.

In product design, this informs the [[Design Thinking]] and [[Double diamond product development]] Philosophy.

For task management, this helps to keep a [[Mind like water]].
