An application that is run on infrastructure entirely managed by a (cloud-)provider, instead of the company developing the application. This presents the purest form of the separation of concerns between running infrastructure and running applications. The developer provides only an executable package in the form of a container or even just code, with an attached configuration that govern how it should be run.

They are typically infinitely scalable, apart from self-imposed quotas used to not accidentally incur huge cost or overwhelm downstream dependencies.
