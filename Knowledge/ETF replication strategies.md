There’s different strategies for [[ETFs]] to implement the tracking of the [[Index (finance)]].

## Physical / Complete replication

Actually owns shares in the stocks behind the index. Regular rebalancing means actually selling or buying stock according to changes in the index.

The downside of this is the high fees for trading with shares, that are accrued with every rebalancing.

## Optimized / physical replication with sampling

The fund will own a sample of shares from the index. The risk diversification isn’t as high as with full physical replication, which is countered by lower fees saved from trading a lot of shares in rebalancing.

## Synthetic replication / Swap ETF

The fund doesn’t need to own any shares from the index. This is essentially like a bet with an investment bank, that holds completely different shares - They are contractually obligated to pay out earnings according to the actual development of the tracked index. The risk is insolvency of the investment bank, countered by even cheaper fees compared to other methods of replication.
