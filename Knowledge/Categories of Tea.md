There are a few different rough categories of [[Tea]]:

**1	White Tea** – White tea is made from the first buds picked and has a light color.

**2	Green Tea** – This is a tea that is pan-fried or steamed to prevent oxidation.

**3	Oolong Tea** – Oolong teas are partially oxidized teas. They could be lightly or darkly oxidized. They might even be  [roasted](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-oolong-tea/) . Some are aged. This where you’ll find many tea lovers. Some of the finest and most expensive tea plants in the world are used to make oolong tea.

**4	Black Tea** – Black tea is fully oxidized tea.

**5	Pu-erh Tea** – Another area of outstanding teas are the pu-erh (pu’er) which are divided into two groups raw (green) and cooked (black). Raw pu-erh is fermented green tea. Cooked is fermented black tea. The tea might be one year old or decades-old. I once had pu-erh tea that was 40 years old.

**6	Herbal** – Herbal tea is not really tea. You might like it, but it is not tea. However, Chai is a mixture of tea and herbs.
