Typically if you move to a new place in Germany, you have 14 days to register with the city. Due to the size of Munich it is a little different here; Since the beginning of 2019 you have to book an appointment online for any of the 6 KVRs (citizen’s office). You cannot just go there anymore, they will refer you to the online system. Typically they are booked out for 2-3 months in advance, so this will take some time. The good news is, the moment you book the appointment, that 14 day deadline is automatically met!

You will get an email confirmation with all the details and just show up 15 minutes before the slot. They have different waiting areas that are color coded, where they will call your number.

1. You select 1 of “Meldeangelegenheiten” > “An/Ummeldung Einzelperson”
2. Click “Weiter”
3. Choose one of the KVRs (any is fine) and see if there is a slot available, select it
4. Put in your information and confirm with “Reservierung abschließen”

Tip: They put in a few more appointments 30 minutes before opening time each day. Also people cancel sometimes, so check every now and then for earlier dates.
