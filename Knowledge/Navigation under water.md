GNS systems are not available under water, because the signal does not reach into the water. There are different alternative approaches for navigation instead:

**Absolute position** relative to an anchor: USBL or LBL systems work like an underwater GNSS. There are senders (speakers) and receivers (hydrophones), and by measuring the distance and pitch between the objects, the absolute position of an object in the water can be determined. The system can be activated at any time to get an accurate position.

Examples:

- Teledyne

**Relative position** to a start point: INS (Inertial Navigation System) and DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) measure the movement of the object while in the water, and infer the relative position from the start point based on thart. The system needs to be active for the entire duration of the operation. The start point can be determined near the surface with GNSS.

Quality is measured by the error rate over long distances.

Examples:

- Teledyne [Wayfinder](http://www.teledynemarine.com/Wayfinder) - 1.15% / 1.2cm/s
- Nortek [DVL series](https://www.nortekgroup.com/products/subsea-navigation) - 0.1% / 0.1cm/s
