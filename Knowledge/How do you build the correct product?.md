It is vital to properly test and validate the market hypothesis as early and as cheaply as possible. Various techniques are described in Book: The Right It.

However, traditional “market research” is dangerous! Real world tests with “skin in the game” are the only way to safely test an assumption.

The rough process is as follows:

- Formulate a market engagement hypothesis with numbers
- XYZ: Say it with numbers
- Hypozoom: Find testable subset
- Pretotype: Verify hypothesis
- YODA
- The Righ It Meter
- Conclusion → Go /Drop /Tweak
