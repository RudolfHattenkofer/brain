Since Stocks are inherently emotional, it is impossible to predict whether they go up or down. It is therefore also not possible to pick “good” companies to invest in by hand, i.e. Hedge funds.

Some improvements can definitely be made, but in reality these returns will always be diminished by increased fees (compared to a passively managed fund). That’s why it is generally wiser to not pick [[Stock]] at all and just buy the entire market via an [[Index (finance)]] that tracks it, i.e. [[ETFs]].
