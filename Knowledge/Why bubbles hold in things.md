Important for [[Foaming milk]].

protein is all tangled up in itself

Some denaturing action (heat, whisking) loosens up protein, it wants to bind to anything else - Air bubbles! The protein wraps around the air bubbles, which makes them stable.

Works for many things, like milk and eggwhite.

Lipids (=fat) are the enemy of this process. Therefore whole milk is harder to foam, though it is tastier.
