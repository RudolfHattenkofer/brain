Are only novel things researched?

Is my job merely the application of something that was already discovered?

What is research in the context of software engineering? What are the areas?

Software engineering vs Computer science

Cloud computing?

Complexity in a monolith vs a distributed application (small vs big project; small doesnâ€™t matter, but for a big team loose coupling etc are more enforced and pay off? deployment speed etc)

Smartly choose system boundaries

Innovation comes from industry, not academia

Disconnect between academia and practice
