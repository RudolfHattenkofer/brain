Borrowed from Maggie Appleton's "[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)"

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

This is specifically referring to the notion of not publishing a personal blog, but rather a personal garden.

One of the earliest, serious, mentions is by Mike Caulfield in a [keynote presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY), which he later detailed in an [essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). Tom Critchlow added and summarized this on his own [blog](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/).
