### Tutorials
A tutorial must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product, so that they can go on to use the product for their own purposes.

A tutorial also needs to show the learner that they can be successful with the product - by having them do something both meaningful and attainable.

Tutorials - learning-oriented guides that describe practical steps and are intended to serve our study.
A tutorial in other words is a lesson - a lesson concerned with learning how rather than learning that, because it’s concerned with skill: practical, not theoretical knowledge.

Having completed a tutorial, the learner should be in a position to start to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the product itself.

For a product, a tutorial turns new learners into users. An inadequate tutorial can prevent a project from acquiring new users.

### How-To Guides
How-to guides can be thought of as recipes, directions that guide the reader through the steps to achieve a specific end.

How-to guides - task oriented, practical steps, that serve our work
Examples could be: how to calibrate the radar array; how to use fixtures in pytest; how to configure reconnection back-off policies. On the other hand, how to build a web application is not - that’s not addressing a specific goal or problem, it’s a vastly open-ended sphere of skill.

How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do. A rich list of how-to guides is an encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

If they’re well-written and address the right subjects, you’re likely to find that how-to guides are the most-read sections of your documentation.
