Should definitely split techniques into structuring teams vs structuring software projects.

## Teams

- SOA (too few people)
- Matrix structure (doesn’t make sense for us)
- Product focused
- Technology focused (don’t like)
- Family Pizza team (too few people)
- Customer oriented

We are a product company with more services than people

Teams should be cross functional with all the people they need to do the job right

## Development workflow

- Agile
- Scrum
- You build it, you run it
- DevOps
- Continuous Integration/Deployment/Delivery
- Domain Driven Development (old?)
