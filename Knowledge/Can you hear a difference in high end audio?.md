[Can you hear a difference in quality between Spotify's 320 kbps stream and TIDAL's HiFi lossless audio stream? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-hear-a-difference-in-quality-between-Spotifys-320-kbps-stream-and-TIDALs-HiFi-lossless-audio-stream)

Is there really a discernable difference between a modern, high quality 320kbps stream and lossless content? Or is the difference mostly in equipment these days?
