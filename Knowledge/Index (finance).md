An index is a set of companies traded on a stock exchange. Popular index providers are MSCI.

Historically, they were used as a benchmark for Hedge funds managers to track their performance over the “market”. When it turned out that [[The market always beats an actively managed fund]], they were turned into their own product through [[ETFs]].

These are often used as the basis for [[ETFs]], see: [[Popular indexes]]
