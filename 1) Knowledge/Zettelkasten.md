Zettelkasten refers to the [[Knowledge Management]] methodology of having many very short notes of literature notes on a Zettel, that are referencing each other. One of the particular quirks of Zettelkasten is that each note is assigned a unique ID that is necessary for linking them together. It works in physical form as well, with actual Zettel in a Zettelkasten :-)
