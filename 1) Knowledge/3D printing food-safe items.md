# 3D printing food-safe items

3D prints are porous and rough, which makes them an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Most materials are not suitable for direct use and need treatment, see [[Treating 3D prints with Epoxy]]

In addition, brass nozzles can leak lead into the print which is harmful. A **stainless steel** nozzle is recommended.

The EU regulation for this is called no. 10/2011
