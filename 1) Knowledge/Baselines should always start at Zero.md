[Chad Skelton: Bar charts should always start at zero. But what about line charts?](http://www.chadskelton.com/2018/06/bar-charts-should-always-start-at-zero.html)

Line charts specifically:

Only truncate the axis if the change on line charts is important (stock price etc), but never if the variations are medium or big scale.

Most line charts should probably start at zero unless doing so makes small, but important, changes hard to see.
