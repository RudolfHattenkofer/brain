Measured variables are time and volume of the Espresso produced. All other factors are input variables that can be varied! The fewer variables, the more consistent results can be achieved.

### Dose

Single 7-9g

Double 14-18g

Dark roasts are ok to use large doses with.

Light roasts are harder to extract, which in combination with large doses can lead to more sour Espresso.

### Grind size

Sour -> Finer

Bitter -> Coarser

### Brew temperature

Darker roasts can benefit from lower brew temperatures, about 80-92C. Lighter roasts need higher temperatures, around 92-96C.

### Brew time

25-35s, from lifting lever to stop

### Pressure

Low pressure during pre-infusion, then pretty much just 9 bars all the way.
