A passively managed index [[Fund]] or exchange-traded fund. They provide a modern alternative to classic Hedge funds with the same goal of [[Risk diversification]], but significantly lower fees. Their goal is to buy an entire market, which they accomplish by tracking an [[Index (finance)]]. They are themselves traded on a [[Stock exchange]].

They are sold by many [[ETF vendors in Germany]] with a [[Stock broker]] and include [[Popular indexes]]. The makeup of these funds is governed by one of the [[ETF replication strategies]], where Dividends are treated like one of the [[Dividend fund strategies]].

The fees for an ETF are usually in the range of 0.2-0.5% per year. To make sure an ETF is not stopped prematurely, it is wise to only invest in funds with 500Mâ‚¬+ of total capital.
