AutoML is the process of finding or optimizing of a [[Machine Learning]] model. It can often be costly to train but produce excellent results. A trade-off can be to use simple but cheap ML models during the [[Feature Engineering]] phase and let AutoML develop a high performance production model.

It is even possible to discover core ML concepts from scratch with [AutoML-Zero](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/automl-zero-evolving-code-that-learns.html), which suggests it is possible to not only apply and tune existing models but develop completely novel approaches.

Example implementations:

- [Model Search](https://github.com/google/model_search)
- Google Cloud AutoML
