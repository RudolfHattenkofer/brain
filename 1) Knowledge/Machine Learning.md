Machine learning is the practice of predicting with high accuracy of new event based on a reasonably large [[Training a ML model|training]] data set.

The finding of a model can itself be automated with [[Automated Machine Learning|Automated]] Machine Learning.

Areas include Natural Language Processing, Image recognition or [[Time Series Forecasting]].

Model types for regression problems include Deep Learning, Neural networks, [[XGBoost]] and Linear regression.

Model types for classification problems include Deep Learning, Neural networks or K-nearest neighbor.
