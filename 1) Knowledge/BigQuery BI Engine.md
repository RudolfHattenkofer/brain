In memory analysis of data; 30$/GB/month

\-> This is a replacement for Tableau extracts!

Somehow I can't get the demo to work.

```other
bq show --format=prettyjson -j job_id
```

Should show something like in the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/bi-engine/docs/sql-interface-overview):

```other
biEngineStatistics": {
}
```

But just doesn't at all.
