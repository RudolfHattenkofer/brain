(Software-) Architekt für eine lebenswertere Zukunft

I like building things (offline/online, Hardware, Software, things)

Why am I having such a hard time pinning down my job description? -> I am a technical lead, not an individual engineer. I develop an architecture and a context for my team to thrive, ensuring they have the information and tools to work efficiently. I drive initiatives to further the company’s strategy.

I want to lead multidisciplinary teams in early stage startups.

This might translate to [[Technical Program Management]] or [[Staff Software Enginer]] at a bigger company.
