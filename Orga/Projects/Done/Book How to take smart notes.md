# Book: How to take smart notes

What matters to me?

- Writing successfully starts before writing, with a good structure
- Problems only occur once you are at a certain level - Dunning Kruger effect
- GTD
   - Store everything in one place, so mind is free and can focus on task at hand
   - “Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.”
- Structure should allow for quick task switching
- Avoid resistance!
- Reliable external system that accounts for limitations of our brain
- Slip box system:
   - One collection of bibliography notes
   - One collection of thoughts
   - Organized so links between them are possible and easy
   - Index / topic notes with links to notes
- Defined achievable tasks
   - Collect ideas, bring them into order
   - Create outline for draft
   - Polish draft into output format (e.g. book/paper)
- Writing about thinking is productive (translate into own words)
- Don’t be afraid of following new ideas, put old ones on hold! No loss, due to working memory.
- Types of notes
   - Fleeting
   - Permanent (literature, own thoughts)
   - Project
- Teachers are bad at determining skill
