## Instructions

**Make paleo Swedish meatballs:**

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients for Swedish meatballs. With your hand, mix well to combine, then roll into evenly sized meatballs. Use a small disher to make this process very easy. Place on a baking sheet and repeat until all meatball mixture is rolled.

Heat a thin layer of coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry meatballs in batches, being careful not to overcrowd, letting brown on one side before turning. Fry until cooked through but not overcooked, about when all sides are browned. Repeat until all meatballs are cooked. Then pour off coconut oil.

**Make Swedish meatballs sauce:**

Return skillet to stove over medium-low heat. Add ghee or coconut oil to skillet and heat through, then stir in sauce binder. Whisk vigorously until well combined, then slowly pour in beef broth. Whisk vigorously; mixture will gel at first but will thin as the remaining broth is whisked in.

When all broth is incorporated and smooth, increase heat to medium and whisk until thickened. Add in coconut cream, Dijon mustard, salt, lots of freshly cracked black pepper, and a dash coconut aminos for color, if desired. Simmer until thickened to desired texture, a couple minutes. Return meatballs to skillet and coat with sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes with plenty of gravy and lingonberry or raspberry jam, see note.
