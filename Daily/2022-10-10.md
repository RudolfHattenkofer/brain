For collecting the customer payment data, we use the prebuilt checkout page in Stripe. The payment is not collected at checkout, just the payment info. Stripe calls this the `SetupIntent`. They have a step-by-step guide here:

[Set up future payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout)

* [ ] [Create Checkout Session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create)
	* [ ] mode = `setup` -> "Collect payment information"
	* [ ] on_behalf_of = Stripe Connect ID of photographer
	* [ ] success_url = Redirect URL for when customer is done collecting info
	* [ ] cancel_url = Redirect URL for when customer cancels
* [ ] Redirect client to the [URL](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response
* [ ] Retrieve the Checkout Session  synchronously using `sessionId`
* [ ] Retrieve the `SetupIntent` using the ID from the Checkout `Session`
* [ ] Create `Customer` and attach the `PaymentMethod` from `SetupIntent`
* [ ] Save this reference to the `Customer` in the Booking
