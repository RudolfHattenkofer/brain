Solidify and structure the foundations for our life together.

Ideal outcomes:
- Established workout routine; Help **prevent**(!) my neck pain
- Formalize a structure for freelancing and s&p work; Keep with the edge of time and ensure cash flow while building a company I love
- Focus on learning more while cooking and eating;
- Solidify personal note taking; Obsidian has been a fantastic (re-) addition to my life, it has brought a lot of structure.
