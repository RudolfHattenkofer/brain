- One Appointment location
- One Day
- One Photographer

Example: Find the first available time for "Mike" on "2022-12-05" at "380 W Fourth St, Boston, MA 02127". This uses 1 SC.

Example: Find the all available times for "Mike" on "2022-12-05" at "380 W Fourth St, Boston, MA 02127". This uses 1 SC.

Example: Find the first available time for any photographer on "2022-12-05" at "380 W Fourth St, Boston, MA 02127". The system finds the nearest photographers and processes them sorted by distance to the site. The third photographer has a slot on "2022-12-05". This used 3SC.
