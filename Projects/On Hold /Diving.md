over oxygenated at depth? -> no, carbon bubbles are the concern

dry suit surface air delivery sense pressure? -> second stage is down, first stage is up

breath out to the sides -> no, old/weird

boye? -> surface marker for boat or rescue

1 bar = 10m

absolute = gauge + 1

pressure compacts air within body

volume = 1/abs pressure, eg 10m=1/2
