## Culture eats strategy for breakfast

Strong core values are important for business success

Shared goals are important for business success

## Scalability

Build the slightly better, scalable solution -> Not the easiest one that cannot be reused, also not the most complex one that is ready built; Tradeoff between build time/cost and reusability/scalability

Incremental improvements, always leave things better than you found them!

## Communication

Document everything, groom notes -> Evergreen Notes

No gurus; Share knowledge!

Answer questions by expanding documentation

## Empowerment

No single dependency, see Communication

Trust your teammates and learn from mistakes

> "Construction worker doesnâ€™t hold up beams; The point is to build lasting structures"

Help teammates with the parts of the job they struggle; empower them in doing what they do well!
