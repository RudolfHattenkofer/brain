- You mean more to me than can ever be put in words / all words feel meaningless compared to how much I love you
- You made me experience what love actually is
- vacation style - planned chaos, siesta
- peoplewatch
- I can tell when she struggles and want to help haha
- Share a lot of time, experiences and food
- Truly be the better half of me
- Take me for what I am

make me feel safe

repetition?

Megan, all words seem meaningless compared to how much love I feel for you.

Being with you fills me with so much joy and gratefulness, because you just take me for who I really am.

Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing many more experiences and food with you, the truly better half of me!
